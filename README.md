# Hi, I'm Marcos Cazaux 👋🏼👨🏻‍💻
I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating technology to elevate people, and building community.

With over 20 years of experience in IT, Marketing and Design, I have oriented my professional career to business web development. I'm a Front End specialist in Javascript / Typescript technologies (Angular, React, VueJS, Ionic), a Bussiness Analyst, a team leader and a UX advocate. My professional experience and direct contact with clients and users allow me to have a business and user focus.

Currently, I am responsible for the Front End Department at the Advanced Technologies Hub in Valencia in Minsait/INDRA. My responsibilities include the development of the Front End architecture, managing a team of 9 Front End developers, a UX designer, and coordinating with other teams (Back End and Management). I am working on the Just@CV project. This project is a new Procedural Management system of the Ministry of Justice, Interior and Public Administration of the Valencian Community, which involves the implementation of the Electronic Judicial File (EJE) and file digitalization of all the judicial bodies and tax offices of the Valencian Community.

Previously, I participated in the entire lifecycle of various IT projects, including consulting, planning, development, implementation, maintenance and support. I have played a key role in directly managing key stakeholders, customers, suppliers and collaborators. Likewise, I have worked on developing desktop applications, e-commerce, ERP and websites, enjoying each project phase worldwide (Argentina, Brazil, Spain, United Kingdom, Norway and Venezuela).

I've worked for advertising and marketing agencies in my early years, where I gained knowledge and experience in the fascinating design world. This experience allows me to have a robust user interface and usability base, which I consider vital for developing digital products.

I am passionate about my profession. I attend various talks, courses, and clubs and participate in volunteer and coaching projects related to the world of technology, the environment and social inclusion. I am especially interested in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Smart City, and Augmented Reality, in which I'm an autodidact.

Passionate, self-taught, responsible, committed and motivated for new challenges with an entrepreneurial and creative attitude. Always open to sharing knowledge and challenges with colleagues, managers and IT enthusiasts.
