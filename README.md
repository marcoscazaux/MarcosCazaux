# Hi, I'm Marcos Cazaux 👋🏼👨🏻‍💻
I'm a Software Architect, Front-End and UX/UI specialist, focused on SAP Spartacus development and a Metaverse advocate.

With over 20 years of experience in IT, Marketing and Design, I have oriented my professional career to Web Development, Team and Technical Leader based in JavaScript / Typescript technologies (Angular, React, VueJS, etc.)

Currently, I´m working in Advanced Technology Centre (ATC) in Accenture Spain. Previously I have worked in other biggest companies as Minsait/INDRA and NTTData. For all this, I have had the honor to participate in amazing projects of important companies or organizations as WIPO, Invesis Banck, Evo Bank, Santander Bank, Orange, Jazztel, Acciona, Heineken, Valencian Community, Paco Rabanne, and other.

I been participated in the entire lifecycle of various IT projects, including consulting, planning, development, implementation, maintenance and support. I have played a key role in directly managing key stakeholders, customers, suppliers and collaborators, enjoying each project phase. My professional experience and direct contact with clients and users allow me to have a business and user focus.

I've worked for advertising and marketing agencies in my early years, where I gained knowledge and experience in the fascinating design world. This experience allows me to have a robust user interface and usability base, which I consider vital for developing current digital products and the new tech opportunities as Metaverse, Extended Reality (XR) and other.

I´m passionate about my profession. I attend various talks, courses, and clubs and participate in volunteer and coaching projects related to the world of technology, the environment and social inclusion. I´m especially interested in Metaverse, Extended Reality (XR) and all his variant of this amazing and revolutionary sector, in which I'm an autodidact.

Passionate, self-taught, responsible, committed and motivated for new challenges with an entrepreneurial and creative attitude. Always open to sharing knowledge and challenges with colleagues, managers and IT enthusiasts.
